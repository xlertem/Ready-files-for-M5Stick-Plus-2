If you don't have an SD card module, you can use some features using only internal storage. You can use features such as CUSTOM BAD, CUSTOM IRTV, CUSTOM IRAC, and CUSTOM EVIL PORTAL. Before you download all the data to LittleFS on your M5Stick Plus 2 or any other device, make sure to clear the storage space to ensure enough room for installation!
